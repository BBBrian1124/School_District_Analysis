# School_District_Analysis
* Module 4 - Pandas, Anaconda and Jupyter

# Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
* We have assisted Maria with preparing and analyising student math and reading scores in order to determine school performance and assist in making decisions on school funding. We completed one set of analysis on the data, however, the school board alerted Maria and her supervisor that the data in the dataset (students_complete.csv) contains invalid data. This was caused by the reading and math grades for 9th graders at Thomas High School being altered, and are thus considered invalid. Due to this invalid data, we have been asked to repeat our analysis by replacing the invalid data and repeating our analysis.

# Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

## How is the district summary affected?

* All of the average scores and % passing has decreased by a small amount/% when comparing the data before the 9th grade data was removed versus after it was removed. 

## How is the school summary affected?

* We can see that the average scores and % passing has decreased by a small amount/% when comparing the data before the 9th grade data was removed versus after it was removed. The only score that increased is the average reading scores.

## How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

* By changing one line of code, we are able to sort the schools ranking based on each of the average scores and % passing. The only rankings that changed for Thomas High School was their average math scores where they dropped from 4th to 5th, and their % passing reading which dropped from 1st to 3rd.

## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

### Math and reading scores by grade

* Since the only change that was done is the grade 9 data at Thomas being removed, there is no impact on the other grades for this specific analysis. The grade 9 data now shows nan as the values we replaced/removed.
